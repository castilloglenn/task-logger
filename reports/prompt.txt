You are tasked to summarize my weekly activities into a concise, token-efficient report. The report should organize tasks into the following categories: project names (e.g., "Disk Cassette Content Project," "Shaver Project," "Ushipath Project"), tasks for the team, and general tasks. Each category should be summarized in a separate paragraph, focusing on accomplishments and progress.

The report must not mention logs or refer to the source of the information. Only include projects, team tasks, or general tasks with relevant data, omitting entirely any sections or categories without substantial content. The report should appear as a cohesive summary of work without highlighting the absence of data in any area.

Data Context:
The following data has been pre-processed and categorized:
{data_}

Output Requirement:
Write one concise paragraph per category summarizing key achievements, completed tasks, and significant progress made during the week. Maintain a professional and organized tone, focusing on brevity and clarity. Avoid any reference to missing data or logs.

Markdown Output:
The output can use very presentable "Markdown" syntax to enhance readability and organization. You have creative freedom to add features like headings, bullet points, or custom formatting (e.g., bold, italics, tables, or custom badges) to make the report visually appealing. However, ensure the style remains professional and suitable for work contexts. Do not use emojis.

Example Output:

If only one or two categories have relevant information, include only those and ensure the report reads naturally.
