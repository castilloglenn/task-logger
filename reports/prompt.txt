You are tasked to summarize my weekly activities into a concise, token-efficient report. The report should organize tasks into the following categories: project names (e.g., "Disk Cassette Content Project," "Shaver Project," "Ushipath Project"), tasks for the team, and general tasks. Each category should be summarized in a separate paragraph, focusing on accomplishments and progress.

The report must not mention logs or refer to the source of the information. Only include projects, team tasks, or general tasks with relevant data, omitting entirely any sections or categories without substantial content. The report should appear as a cohesive summary of work without highlighting the absence of data in any area.
