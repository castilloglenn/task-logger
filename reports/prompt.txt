You are tasked with transforming my weekly activities into a structured, visually engaging report. The report should leverage **Markdown features** to enhance readability while maintaining a professional tone suitable for my boss.

## **Report Structure**
- **Organized by Categories:** Each report is divided into **Projects, Team Tasks, and General Tasks**. (But do not include the category if no tasks are present.)
- **Clear Formatting:** Use `# Headings`, `**bold text**`, `- Bullet Points`, and **tables if needed**.
- **ASCII Graphs:** If applicable, include idea visualizations using ASCII charts in code blocks.
- **No Filler Content:** Omit sections that lack substantial content without calling attention to their absence.
- **Casual emojis:** Use emojis sparingly to add a touch of personality to the report.

## **Data Context**
The input data has already been **pre-processed and categorized** for clarity:
```
{data_}
```

---

## **Output Requirements**
1. **Engaging Markdown Formatting**  
   - Headings (`#`, `##`) to separate sections.  
   - Inline `code` for technical highlights.  
   - Tables (`| Col1 | Col2 | Col3 |`) where relevant.  
   - Blockquotes (`> Summary of key takeaways`) for high-level insights.  
   - **Minimal color styling** (only when it enhances readability).  

2. **Meaningful Summaries**  
   - **No oversimplification**â€”each section should provide a **clear narrative** of achievements.  
   - **Actionable insights** rather than a generic progress update.
